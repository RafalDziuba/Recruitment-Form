Hello!
Thank you for reviewing my code. 
I know, that Vuex and Vue Router may be overkill in this mini project, but I did this because I want to show, that I can work with these technologies.
I also want to add, that If I had more time - I would add some route guardians and mixins to scss code, to avoid repeating flex configuration.

Thanks for reading this :) Best regards!
